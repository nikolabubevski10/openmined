#### Courses

The OpenMined Courses website where we host our educational material. The site is a [React.js](https://reactjs.org) web application, running on a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) backend, [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing, [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for end-to-end testing, and using [Sanity.io](https://sanity.io) as the content management system (CMS).
